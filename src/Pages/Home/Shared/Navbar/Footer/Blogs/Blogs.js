                        Local (UI) state – Local state is data we manage in one or another
                        component. Local state is most often managed in React using the
                        useState hook.

                        Global (UI) state – Global state is data we manage across multiple
                        components. Global state is necessary when we want to get and update
                        data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least.

                        can be hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI
                        state.

            question: "How does prototypical inheritance work?",
            answer: [
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, objects have a special hidden property [[Prototype]]
                    (as named in the specification), that is either null or references
                    another object. That object is called “a prototype”:
                </p>,
                <p>
                    When we read a property from object, and it’s missing, JavaScript
                    automatically takes it from the prototype. In programming, this is
                    called “prototypal inheritance”. And soon we’ll study many examples of
                    such inheritance, as well as cooler language features built upon it.
                    <br />
                    The property [[Prototype]] is internal and hidden, but there are many
                    ways to set it.
                </p>,
                <p>
                    The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
                    methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object
                    can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
                    Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object,
                    we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.

            question: "What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?",
            answer: [
                <p>
                    A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code
                    that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming
                    languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. The
                    isolated part of the definition is important.

                    <br />
                    For Test-Driven Development (TDD), you write unit tests before writing
                    any implementation. This makes your implementation details in your
                    code shorter and easier to understand. In this instance, the best time
                    to write unit tests is immediately. For others, most developers write
                    unit tests after the code's been written.

            question: "React vs. Angular vs. Vue?",
            answer: [
                <p>
                    One of the main reasons for the popularity of React is that it works
                    very efficiently with the DOM. Vue also uses the virtual DOM, but
                    compared to React, Vue has better performance and stability. According
                    to this data, Vue and React's performance difference is subtle since
                    it is only a few milliseconds.
                </p>,
                <p>
                    <span className="font-semibold underline">Angular vs React</span>
                    <br />
                    If the choice you’re making is based on Angular vs React alone, then
                    you’ll simply need to consider the pros and cons discussed for those
                    libraries in this post. But overall, keep in mind that both libraries
                    can be used for mobile and web apps, while Angular is generally better
                    for more complex apps that are enterprise-ready. React often requires
                    extra modules and components, which keeps the core library small, but
                    means there’s extra work involved when incorporating outside tools.
                    Angular, on the other hand, is more of a full-fledged solution that
                    doesn’t require extras like React often does, though it does have a
                    steeper learning curve for its core compared to React.
                </p>,
                <p>
                    <span className="font-semibold underline">React vs Vue</span>
                    <br />
                    Vue might be the best choice if you’re a newer developer and not as
                    familiar with advanced JavaScript concepts, while React is quite well
                    suited for experienced programmers and developers who have worked with
                    object-oriented JavaScript, functional JavaScript, and similar
                    concepts.
                </p>,
                <p>
                    <span className="font-semibold underline">Angular vs Vue</span>
                    <br />
                    In most cases, you probably wouldn’t be deciding between only Angular
                    and Vue. They are vastly different libraries with very different
                    feature sets and learning curves. Vue is the clear choice for less
                    experienced developers, and Angular would be preferred for those
                    working on larger apps. A large library like Angular would require
                    more diligence in keeping up with what’s new, while Vue would be less
                    demanding in this regard and the fact that the two most recent major
                    releases of Vue are in separate repositories helps.
